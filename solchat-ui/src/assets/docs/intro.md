## Introduction

THChatUI V2.0.0 is an **open-source large model conversation WebUI** designed for **data-sensitive individuals/organizations/companies**, developed based on Vue and Element Plus. It enables quick and easy integration with local large models while protecting information security. This project is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license.

The frontend is built with Vue for better development experience.

The backend uses Python's Flask for quick API setup, with several example implementations provided (optional).

No additional database required - data is stored in the browser's **IndexedDB**.

## Features Overview

### API Request Modes
This project supports two modes: **Custom Model Interface** and **Third-party HTTP Requests**:
1. (Developer-friendly) **Custom Model Interface**: Requires loading local models and running THChatUI's Python scripts. Provides SSE and WS request template implementations, supports all HF platform conversation models, and completely protects privacy from third-party access. We have provided several examples in the `/thchat-server` directory for reference.
2. (User-friendly) **Third-party HTTP Requests**: Only requires obtaining a KEY from third-party platforms and entering it in "Settings" â€” "API KEY". This project permanently provides iFlytek Spark Lite model for platform experience.
